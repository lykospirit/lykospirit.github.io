                <div class="content">
                    It is interesting to see that inverse kinematics uses similar techniques to solving other non-linear systems in other applications; for instance, image homologies and 3D reconstruction. The lecture brought up several questions:
                    <ul><li>Does modern software provide multiple options for solvers, given that each potentially provides different behaviors? Do animators have a "favourite" numerical solver that they are comfortable working with, or are the differences negligible to the human eye?</li>
                    <li>How do we prevent "jerky" motion that could result from the iterative nature of these algorithms, say, by picking a &#x394;&#x3B8; that is too large or inconsistent solving times in a real-time application?</li></ul>

                <div class="title">MoCap Demo</div>
                <div class="content">I had never been in a MoCap studio before this semester and it was exciting to be able to see it in action. I was impressed by how quickly the input from multiple cameras, which were not necessarily at the same positions during each calibration and were aimed at a noisy and cluttered background, was parsed and analysed quickly enough to provide a realtime rendering of a skeletal pose. The examples of animations and research that was being done at the studio were also enlightening and got me thinking about the broad range of applications that motion captured data could be useful for.</div>

                <div class="title">Introduction to Technical Animation</div>
                <div class="content">Talking about the different forms of animation was insightful to understanding what to expect in the coming semester, and to seeing how animation has evolved across history. While there are numerous up and coming technologies that change how animations are created and rendered, it was interesting to see that understanding key, basic techniques like keyframing is still important for good animations. <br><br> The section on creating autonomous animation was also interesting because although the results were not as seamless and natural as manual keyframing could accomplish, their relative popularity in research points to the diverse applications of this technology, in interactive media for instance. It was interesting to think about the potential uses for these techniques while looking at the examples of physics-based and autonomous/learned animation.</div>
