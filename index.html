                <div class="content">Talking about the different forms of animation was insightful to understanding what to expect in the coming semester, and to seeing how animation has evolved across history. While there are numerous up and coming technologies that change how animations are created and rendered, it was interesting to see that understanding key, basic techniques like keyframing is still important for good animations. <br><br> The section on creating autonomous animation was also interesting because although the results were not as seamless and natural as manual keyframing could accomplish, their relative popularity in research points to the diverse applications of this technology, in interactive media for instance. It was interesting to think about the potential uses for these techniques while looking at the examples of physics-based and autonomous/learned animation.</div>
